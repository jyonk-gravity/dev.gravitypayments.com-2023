###üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èDID YOU KNOW?
That FileBird now comes with an addon to help you create a standalone WordPress document gallery using Gutenberg and FileBird folders? 
‚Üí Be sure to check it out: [FileBird Document Library](https://wordpress.org/plugins/filebird-document-library/).

###üëç HOW DOES FILEBIRD WORK?
Are you a WordPress website administrator?

Managing a WordPress site means that you‚Äôll be adding tons of multi-media files such as images, videos, audios, documents, etc., into your WP media library.

As a result, your library has to store thousands of files and could become a total mess. WordPress default file name search function is a good thing but it will never match the ease of going directly to a folder. That‚Äôs when FileBird comes in to help with managing files in WordPress!

This media file manager gives you the ability to easily organize all files by drag and drop between folders. With FileBird in hand, things will be a lot better than they were.

The best thing about a folder-based structure is it makes it very easy to find the files you need and saves you so much time.

You won‚Äôt see WordPress media library not loading, as FileBird smart-loads one folder at a time.

###üöÄ Tips to manage WP media folders like a pro with FileBird
